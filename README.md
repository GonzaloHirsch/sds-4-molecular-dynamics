# Simulaci√≥n de Sistemas - TP4

## Simulation
Before running the script, it is needed permissions:
```
chmod u+x ./scripts/run_oscillator.sh
```

To run the analytical and numerical simulations at the same time, the script can be used:
```
./scripts/run_oscillator.sh 0.0001 50
```

Where `0.0001` is the delta of time, and `50` is the amount of delta of time to be skipped each time when generating output.
